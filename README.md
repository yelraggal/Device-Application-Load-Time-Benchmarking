DALTB is a collaborative project where a team of 5 students works together to benchmark the load time of various applications on different devices. The project involves running the same set of applications multiple times on each device and recording the average load time. Automation tools like PyAutoGUI or pywinauto are utilized to streamline the process. The results are tabulated and analyzed to provide insights into application performance across different devices.
